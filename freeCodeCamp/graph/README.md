# Type of graph

1. Undirected Graph
2. Directed Graph(Digraph)
   1. Indicating Edges
3. Weighted Graphs
   1. Edges has weight
4. Trees
   1. Undirected Graph
5. Rooted Trees
   1. A tree with a designated root node
6. Directed Acyclic Graphs(DAGs)
   1. A directed graphs with no cyelcs
7. Bipartite Graph
   1. A bipartite graph is one whoes vertieces can be split into two independent groups U, V such that every edge connectes betweens U and V.
8. Complete Graphs
   1. a unique edge between every pair of nodes.

# Representing graph

1. Adjacency Matrix
   1. indicating arrows
   2. weight of edges
2. Adjacency List
   1. node have direction
3. Edge List
   1. unordered list of edges
   2. this representation is seldomly used
      1. because it is lack of structure

# Common Graph Theory Problems

## Questions

1. Is the graph directed or undirected?
2. Are the edges of the graph weighted?
3. Is the graph I will encounter likely to be sparse or dense with edges?
4. Should I use an adjacency matrix, adjacency list, an edge list or other structure to represent the graph efficiently?

## Shortest path broblem

1. Given a weighted graph, find the shortest path of edges from node A to B.
   1. Algorithms: BFS(unweighted graph)
   2. Dijkstra's
   3. Folyed-Warchall
   4. Bellman-Ford
   5. A\*

## Connectivity

1. DFS

## Negative cycles

1. Bellman-Ford and Floyed Warshall
2.
